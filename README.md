# ViEWD - A lightweight PHP template engine

It's not about reinventing anything - it's about using what's already there.

**ViEWD** is a minimalist template engine for PHP. Since it relies on PHP's
built-in standard-functionality and doesn't use any other special language, it's
considered a *native* template engine.
